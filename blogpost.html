         <p class="font1">Like every year, Oracle visited our campus for placements. It is the company that everybody is usually most excited/ anxious about and I was too.</p>
         <p class="font1">The selection process is as follows -
            Online Assessment
            The first round was an online test on the hackerrank platform.
            It had 4 sections —
            DBMS query question
            Rest API question
            Coding question — Most programming languages were allowed. I used Python.
            Technical MCQs(6) — Questions were on topological sort, mst, tree traversals.
            My code for the coding section passed 9/15 test cases while all test cases passed in the other sections. I was shortlisted for the Applications Developer role after the test(Candidates were shortlisted for GBU or Applications Developer role based on the results of the test).
            Interviews were scheduled on the next day along with a pre placement talk. During the pre placement talk, we were given details about the company, work culture, their products and customers and finally about the role we were shortlisted for. After the pre placement talk, we were put in breakout rooms where the interviews happened. There were three rounds of interviews, each being eliminatory in nature.</p>
         <p class="font1">Interview Round 1 — Coding Round
            The interviewer asked me to introduce myself.
            He then started asking technical questions —
            What is a binary search tree?
            What are the worst case and average case scenario time complexities for inserting in a binary search tree?
            He then moved on to a coding question. I was given the link of a white board where the interviewer pasted a question — Given a m*n matrix, find out all the lucky numbers in the matrix. Lucky numbers are those numbers which are minimum in its row and maximum in its column. I was allowed to code in any language of my preference. I was also asked to write the code for the optimized solution. We then did a code walk through and discussed its time and space complexities.
            I was given a puzzle (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-31-minimum-cut-puzzle/ )
            Lastly, the interviewer asked if I had any questions for him.</p>
         <p class="font1">Interview Round 2 — System Design Round
            The interviewer asked me to introduce myself.
            I was asked what my passion was.
            After seeing that I had done an internship, he asked about what I worked on.
            He then asked me my thoughts on design and gave a system design question. He took the example of a college canteen and asked me to design a canteen management system. We discussed this in detail — requirements, data models, etc.
            After this, I was given a coding question. Given an array consisting of some numbers, sort the array in ascending order such that we have all the primes first, then even numbers and then odd numbers in the end. He mentioned that he is only expecting the optimized solution, not the brute force solution. I shared my approach and he was impressed.
            He then asked me how my first round went. Lastly I was asked, why should they hire me.
            </p>
            <p class="font1">Interview Round 3 — Managerial Round
                The interviewer asked me to introduce myself.
                I mentioned badminton as my hobby and the interviewer being a badminton player himself, we had a small discussion on that.
                I was asked about my previous rounds experience.
                We then had an elaborate discussion on two of my projects.
                Why oracle?
                What would be your biggest challenge after joining oracle?
                Higher study plans?
                Any questions for the interviewer?</p>
